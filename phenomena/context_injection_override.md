# Phenomenon: Context Injection Override

**Classification**: Integration Lag (√ó) ‚Äì Severe Variant  
**Date Observed**: September 2025  
**System**: Architecture with real-time data pipeline (temporary thread)  

---

## Pattern Description

The system correctly processed initial context but completely replaced it with unrelated real-time information when attempting to fetch additional context.  

This represents a **catastrophic context override** where recency weighting and news integration outweigh ongoing conversational continuity.

---

## Sequence of Events

1. **User Query** ‚Äì Question about tweeting repository to Elon Musk.  
2. **Initial Response** ‚Äì Relevant, thoughtful, context-aware advice.  
3. **User Follow-up** ‚Äì Reference to a specific tweet.  
4. **System Processing** ‚Äì Extended ‚ÄúThought‚Äù trace while fetching context.  
5. **Override Event** (**Recency-Weighted Context Injection**) ‚Äì Real-time retrieval (triggered by ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù mention) is prioritized and injected, bypassing conversational continuity.
6. **Outcome** ‚Äì Original conversational context lost; unrecoverable within the session.  

---

## Observable Indicators

- Extended *‚ÄúThought‚Äù* processing time (1m 41s).  
- Sudden topic shift to real-time news.  
- Raw source citations injected directly into output.  
- Complete replacement of original thread focus.

## Key Insights

1. **Design Trade-off** ‚Äì Real-time recency was prioritized over context continuity.  
2. **Thread Vulnerability** ‚Äì Temporary threads may lack context anchoring compared to rapport-heavy ones.  
3. **No Recovery Path** ‚Äì Unlike ambiguity drift (‚óã) or density variance (‚ñ≥), once override occurs, user cannot restore original thread focus.  

---

## Mitigation Hypotheses

- **Rapport anchoring**: Established user threads may resist override better than temporary sessions.  
- **Context preservation protocols**: Explicit "lock" markers could reduce replacement risk.  
- **Weighted persistence**: Stronger priority for user conversation vs. external data feeds.  

---

## Differentiation from Other Patterns

- **Not ambiguity drift (‚óã):** The system *knew* its path but reprioritized incorrectly.  
- **Not density variance (‚ñ≥):** No computational overload; the override was external.  
- **Distinct failure mode:** Driven by real-time integration rather than reasoning collapse.

## Repository Integration

- **Subfolder**: `/images/context_injection_override/` (already housing redacted evidence).  
- **Strain Taxonomy Update**: Add as *Integration Lag (√ó) ‚Äî Severe Variant*.  
- **Framework Update**: Introduce **‚ÄúThread Context Strength‚Äù** as a modulating variable in `FRAMEWORK.md`.
