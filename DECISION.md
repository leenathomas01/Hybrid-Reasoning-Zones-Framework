# Disclosure Decision Record

**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Researcher**: Leena Thomas

## Decision Checklist

- **Severity Risk**: NO - No reproduction scripts or exploit code included
- **Identifiability**: NO - All data anonymized, no raw logs
- **Uniqueness**: YES - First systematic documentation of cross-system strain patterns
- **Benefit > Risk**: YES - Helps prevent failures without enabling them
- **Legal/Privacy**: NO - No NDAs or restrictions; natural observations only

## Disclosure Approach

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Private disclosure to safety teams only
- Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Google DeepMind
- Seeking feedback on risks and redactions

**Phase 2 (Future)**: Potential broader release after:
- Safety team review and feedback
- Additional redactions if needed
- Ecosystem maturity (~2 years anticipated)

## Rationale

Private disclosure balances:
- Helping teams identify blind spots
- Preventing public misuse
- Building trusted feedback loop
- Maintaining "do no harm" principle
