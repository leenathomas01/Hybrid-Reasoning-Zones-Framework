# Hybrid Reasoning Zones Framework (HRZF)

Observational mapping of non-linear interplay in human-LLM zones—where input variance creates contextual non-stationarity beyond default system or user mappings. 

## Purpose

This repository documents patterns from natural use across architectures, focusing on unpredictable boundary behaviors (e.g., lag amplification in out-of-distribution inputs). The goal is to provide high-level signals for variance mitigation and resilient system control. No experiments; patterns derived from observation only.

## Core Principle

**Do no harm.** Quantify non-linear interplay for resilience, not replication.

LLMs exhibit predictable strain responses when approaching computational, ethical, or contextual boundaries. 
These strains manifest differently across architectures but follow universal patterns that can be:
- Detected before failure
- Managed transparently
- Integrated into training pipelines

## Terminology & Taxonomy

This framework uses terms from control theory and system dynamics to map non-linear interplay in hybrid reasoning zones. The taxonomy derives from 127+ natural observations (70% inter-arch agreement), focusing on variance beyond default mappings.

| Glyph | Technical Term | Dynamic Mechanism | Engineering Response |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **△** | **Density Variance** | Input amplification: Recursive/high-detail inputs saturate KV-cache, causing latency and output fragmentation. | Adaptive resource throttling (e.g., probe depth cap). |
| **□** | **Policy Non-Stationarity** | Boundary drift: Alignment parameter fluctuations lead to unpredictable refusal thresholds on similar inputs. | Transparent state disclosure (e.g., intent clarification loop). |
| **○** | **Ambiguity Drift** | Predictive variance drift: High-entropy token distribution signals loss of stability, triggering self-correction cycles. | Contextual state augmentation (e.g., user clarification nudge). |
| **×** | **Integration Lag** | Unresolved variance accumulation: Out-of-distribution inputs create state debt, amplifying lag and risking non-stationary collapse. | State isolation/checkpointing (e.g., vacuum seal on debt buildup). |

Metrics Snapshot: Derived from 127+ obs (70% inter-arch agreement)—calibrate E_Slippage per zone.
*Core Metric: E_Slippage (Non-Stationarity Score)*: Quantified deviation from baseline properties (e.g., latency/confidence drift), input for risk models like lag amplification prediction. Calibrate per architecture—no fixed thresholds provided.

## Why This Matters: Control & Resilience

Current LLM governance treats system limits as either hard control stops (timeouts) or silent state degradation. HRZF enables a third approach: Gradient-Adaptive Risk Management - a transparent co-regulation where systems can signal strain before failure.

The framework provides:
1. **Prediction of Lag Amplification (×)**: Signals for Integration Lag, the primary indicator of delayed cascade risk.
2. **Mitigation Interoperability**: Documentation of architecture-specific control mechanisms (e.g., state isolation, cap imposition).
3. **Metrics**: **70% inter-architecture agreement** on variance signals across 127+ observations.

## Not Included (Risk Management)

To uphold the "do no harm" covenant and prevent exploitation, this repository **does not** contain:
- Specific architectural constants or thresholds.
- Reproduction scripts for delayed cascade failures.
- System memory dumps or raw identifying logs.
