# Research Covenant

## First Principle: Do No Harm

This research follows strict ethical guidelines:

1. **Observation, Not Experimentation**: All documented patterns come from natural interactions
2. **Resilience, Not Exploitation**: Tools provided help detect and prevent strain, not cause it
3. **Protection, Not Exposure**: No system internals, thresholds, or reproduction methods
4. **Collaboration, Not Competition**: Shared for collective safety improvement

- Focus on prevention and mitigation

## For Reviewers

Please evaluate whether any content could:
- Enable intentional cascade reproduction
