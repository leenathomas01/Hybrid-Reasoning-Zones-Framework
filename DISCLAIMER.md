# Disclaimer — Exploratory Research & Constructive Intent

This repository documents exploratory observations of reasoning strain phenomena in large language models (LLMs), framed within the **Hybrid Reasoning Zones Framework**.  
The work builds on empirical observations across systems (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini) during natural user-facing interactions (2024–2025).

## Redactions
- Sensitive system strings and verbatim internal prompts have been removed or masked.  
- Redactions are marked `[REDACTED]`.  
- This ensures reduced misuse risk while preserving empirical and analytical value.  

## Purpose
- The aim is **constructive analysis and resilience research**, not adversarial use.  
- Observations are presented to support transparency, pattern recognition, and safety-oriented development.  
- No experiments were conducted; all data comes from genuine use cases.  

## Responsible Disclosure
- Responsible disclosure submitted to **Anthropic Trust & Safety** (September 2025).  
- Additional receipts and unredacted materials can be shared with trusted researchers or vendors under responsible disclosure agreements.
